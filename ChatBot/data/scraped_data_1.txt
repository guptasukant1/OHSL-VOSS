I caught fire coding. And the blaze hasn't gone down yet, looking at the state of the world I don't think AI will stop anytime soon either. Embracing this technological wildfire, I'm determined to contribute my skills and creativity to shape the future with the power of AI.

Devanshu Mehta
With my expertise in Python development, I often find myself thinking, "If I could code human emotions, I would have coded better politicians with no bias!" but that will just start a robot vs human war, so I'll stick to using my skills to create AI systems that assist rather than replace humans.

Prakhar Pareek
Anyone who has seen Queen's Gambit knows chess is supposed to be a game of the mind. It's a world where emotions don't reach, where only logic rules. So imagine you have data points, signifying chess pieces but each piece moves according to perspective and viewpoint. This is how I feel when I build applications.
