Interestingly, new breast cancer incidence cases amongst females under 45 years of age also has the largest percentage in Asia (52.9%). Furthermore, mortality due to breast cancer in this age group also peaks in Asia with 51.4 %. Five year prevalence in breast cancer in the same age group also has Asia peaking at 51.1%. In the United States too breast is the most common site for cancer amongst females of all ages (39.9%) with the percentage jumping to 45.6 % amongst females under 50 years of age. [1]",

The rate of incidence was found to be 25.8 in 100,000 women and the mortality rate is 12.7 per 100,000 women (2017). Another troubling concern about the scenario of BC in India is theincreased incidence of the disease in younger Indian women(between the ages of 30 and 40). Presently, almost 48% of patients with BC in India are below 50 years of age. There is an increasing trend of BC in women between the ages of 25 and 40 in the past 25 years. The latest surveillance trends from 2000 to 2014 based on registries from 71 countries estimated the 5-year survival ratio to be 66.1% in India which is the lowest levels among the countries included in the\u00a0study [3].",

These novel big data resources are applied across a variety of contexts-from health services research using data from insurance claims, cancer registries, and electronic health records, to deeper and broader genomic characterizations of disease. Recently, the emergence of Big Data technologies has generated a lot of interest among the medical community concerned with breast health. Indeed, the available storage capacities increased exponentially during the last three decades, thus leading to bigger volumes and variety of stored medical data (e.g., mammography scans, 3D ultrasound, MRI, genomic data, pathological data, etcetera).\u00a0However, Big data is not confined just to genomics.
